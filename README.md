# Front-End Developer Skills Assessment

This skills assessment involves a few tasks that are similar to tasks you may receive in your role as front-end developer for Chapman Auto. Please fork this repository, complete the tasks to the best of your ability, and make a pull request with your completed changes. All the assets needed for these tasks are included in a folder named "assignment-files." Any assets used in the project should be moved out of this folder into appropriate locations. Treat the assessment as if it was a real task assigned to you in your role as front end developer.

> Please keep in mind that these tasks are extremely simplified versions of actual tasks you may receive. I promise that your day to day work will be much more interesting and varied.

### Tasks

1. There is a bug in the WeatherBanner component. Please problem solve and fix it.
2. The design department would like to include some images next to the Chapman Cares event descriptions. Please add the images to the left of the description text.
3. Please add a third section to the page, based on the provided design comp. There is a form in the design, and when submitted the user should see a loading indicator for 1.5 seconds, then a success message. The form details should be stored in vuex. There have been some problems with users double clicking, so please disable the button during submission.

> Notes:
> - Page should be responsive.

> - This skills assessment is voluntary, and your results will not be used for any Chapman products. If you feel that the assessment is too much or is taking too long, please stop working on it and let me know.
